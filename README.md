# RISCV_MYTH-WORKSHOP
## Designed a  RISC-V ISA based 5-Stage pipelined CPU in 5 days!! The design involved TL-Verilog coding for a simple pipelined calculator and addressed all the hazards.

Below are the tasks performed in 5-Day workshop

## DAY-1 : Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain
1. Introduction to RISC-V basic keywords

2. Labwork for RISC-V software toolchain

3. Integer number representation

4. Signed and unsigned arithmetic operations

## DAY-2 : Introduction to ABI and basic verification flow
1. Application Binary interface (ABI)

2. Lab work using ABI function calls

3. Basic verification flow using iverilog

## DAY-3 : Digital Logic with TL-Verilog and Makerchip (http://makerchip.com/)
1. Combinational logic in TL-Verilog using Makerchip

2. Sequential and pipelined logic

3. Validity

4. Hierarchy

## DAY-4 : Basic RISC-V CPU micro-architecture
1. Microarchitecture and testbench for a simple RISC-V CPU

2. Fetch, decode, and execute logic

3. RISC-V control logic

## DAY-5 : Complete Pipelined RISC-V CPU micro-architecture/store
1. Pipelining the CPU

2. Load and store instructions and memory

3. Completing the RISC-V CPU
